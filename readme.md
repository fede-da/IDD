# Summary 

This is my own **IDD**'s project repository, it's a Maven project that contains sub-Maven projects.

Each subproject is relative to a specific homework. Homework's folders run methods defined in the custom library "my-lucene-library" that needs to be locally installed using Maven before proceeding. 

## Prerequisites

Run the _maven-build_ script to build the project and ensure no errors are present.
